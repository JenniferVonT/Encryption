Gemma was only five minutes away from her parents’ hut, but the jungle had already taken on a different personality.
It was thicker. The trees had grown taller. The ti plants shaded the green forest a sinister red. There was no doubt about it- the jungle was more dangerous here, and Gemma loved it.
As a baby, Gemma’s parents had taken her on their expeditions over mountains, deserts, and vast seas. It was exciting, unpredictable, and deeply irresponsible. Now that they had settled down in the tropical rainforest, Gemma had to devise intricate plans just to sneak out for morning adventures.
This particular plan hinged on the help of Milo, her ring-tailed lemur.
Years of mischief, tom-foolery, and Gemma’s influence had helped Milo develop skills that other lemurs would give theirs rings to have themselves, were such a transaction to be made possible.
And on this morning, Milo was lying in Gemma’s bed, wearing a wig made of straw, the same sandy blonde color as Gemma’s hair, snoring loudly.
In a stroke of genius, they had even braided it into pigtails to match her style.
They tried adding a pair of her old glasses but those kept sliding down his face, given that she had a human-sized head, and his was irreparably lemur-sized.
“I swear, her snoring is getting worse and worse,” said Gemma’s dad from the breakfast table, sipping on a warm tea.
Gemma’s mom raised an eyebrow from across her book.
“It doesn’t even sound human!” he continued.
“You’re exaggerating a little, don’t you think, dear?” Gemma’s mom said. 
But he was not.
And had either of them walked one room over to check on their daughter, they may have shouted, and woken up a little, groggy primate with straw pigtails. 
A short walk away, Gemma brushed past a prickly bush and followed a small break in the twisted liana vines.
She came to a wall of leaves and grew excited at the sound of movement ahead.
She often felt like she could sense when adventure was near.
In fact, she felt it almost every single day, and for the past year, she had been wrong roughly every single time.
So, despite the eagerness to find something remarkable, her shock was genuine when she brushed the leaves aside.
In a small clearing, no larger than a rock pond, was a black jaguar. 
She bravely, confidently, froze.
As she rubbed the condensation from her glasses, Gemma spotted a small mammal underneath the jaguar’s paw.
Further rubbing led to further clarity, and she recognized the animal as a golden mole.
Both rare and beautiful.
A fear rushed in that, if she didn’t act soon, the mole would be eaten or crushed under the jaguar’s leg.
