# Basic-Encryption
This is a java application that encrypts and decrypts based on these methods:
- Substitution
- Transposition

All files that are to be processed should be put in the `./src/main/textFiles` folder.<br>
The `message_enc.txt` file will display the encrypted file and the `message_dec.txt` will display the decrypted file.

### Acceptable filetypes:
- .txt

## Start
The application should start by running the console command:
`./gradlew run -q --console=plain`

To build the application run:
`./gradlew build`

After it is started you can just follow the prompts in the terminal.
